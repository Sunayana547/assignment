# Interview Project - Blog Application

This project is a Medium-inspired blog application consisting of a React frontend and a simple backend.

## Project Structure

- **[frontend/](./frontend/)**: The main React application. This contains all the UI, logic, and styling for the blog.
- **[backend/](./backend/)**: A simple backend implementation for handling data (if applicable).

## How to Get Started

To run the application, navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions in its [README.md](./frontend/README.md).

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

*Note: This project was developed as part of a personal portfolio/interview practice to showcase React, CSS responsiveness, and clean UI design.*
